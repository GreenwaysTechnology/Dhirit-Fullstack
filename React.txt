What is react?
 A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

What is Angular?
  Angular is javascript framework for building user interfaces

What is Vue.js?
 Vue.js is javascript framework for building user interfaces

What is lib and framework?

 lib solves only one problem where as framework provides every thing end to end to build apps

Angular vs React:

1.Design pattern

 Angular uses traditional MVC design pattern 

React uses "Flux" design pattern

Flux is new design pattern to design ui invented by facebook.

https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview

In Flux pattern react is "View/Ui/Presentation" Layer.

In Flux Pattern data is changed via "One directional Flow", You cant change data directly.

2.Coding style
  
 Any User interface development frameworks provides 
  1.Markup  - html code,css
  2.Data 

Angular isloates 
  markup(html,css) into separate  called "templates"
  data into services(holding data and biz logic)

React isloates
  markup into js code
  data into js code- hooks,state  management libs like redux...
 React embeds everything into javascript...

Programming files 
  Angular maintains lot of files, components,services,modules,directives,filters etc..which makes code base heavier

  React maintains very less code - components,statement management files,hooks...

Common things in both:

 Component driven, props
